# Fake News Detection Using LSTM

This project implements a deep learning model to classify news articles as **REAL** or **FAKE** using text analysis. The model leverages the TensorFlow library and an LSTM-based architecture to capture the sequential patterns in text data.

## Introduction

The rise of fake news has led to the need for robust systems to detect and filter misinformation. This project builds a text classification model using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and an LSTM network to classify news articles as REAL or FAKE.

---

## Dataset

The dataset is expected to contain the following columns:
- `text`: The content of the news article.
- `label`: The classification label, either "REAL" or "FAKE".

You can use any labeled dataset for fake news detection. Make sure it is saved as a CSV file (e.g., `news.csv`).

---

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Split the data into training, development, and test sets.
   - Tokenize the text and convert it into sequences.
   - Pad the sequences to ensure uniform length.

2. **Model Design**:
   - Embed the words into dense vectors.
   - Use LSTM layers to capture sequential information.
   - Apply dropout to prevent overfitting.
   - Add fully connected layers for classification.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Compile the model using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.
   - Train the model on the training data and validate it on the development set.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model on the test set.
   - Analyze performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualization.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Plot confusion matrices and accuracy comparison charts.

## Model Architecture

- **Embedding Layer**: Converts words into dense vectors.
- **LSTM Layers**: Extracts sequential patterns.
- **Dropout Layers**: Prevents overfitting.
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers for binary classification.
- **Activation Functions**:
  - ReLU for intermediate layers.
  - Sigmoid for the final output.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.0+
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection-lstm.git
   cd fake-news-detection-lstm
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place your dataset (`news.csv`) in the project directory.

---

## Usage

1. Preprocess the data and train the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

2. Evaluate the model and visualize the results:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

3. View the confusion matrices and accuracy charts in the output.

---

## Results

- **Development Set Accuracy**: _e.g., 82.46%_
- **Test Set Accuracy**: _e.g., 79.34%_

Confusion matrices and accuracy comparison charts are generated during evaluation for better insights.

---

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate additional preprocessing steps (e.g., stopword removal, lemmatization).
- Experiment with advanced architectures like Bidirectional LSTM or transformers.
- Add explainability features using SHAP or LIME.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters using Keras Tuner or grid search.
- Add a user-friendly front-end for live news classification.
